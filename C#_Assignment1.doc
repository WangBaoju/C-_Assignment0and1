Introduction to C# and Data Types

Understanding Date Types

    1. What type would you choose for the following “numbers”?
        A person’s telephone number-----String
        A person’s height          -----float
        A person’s age             -----int
        A person’s gender (Male, Female, Prefer Not To Answer) ---- String
        A person’s salary          -----Decimal
        A book’s ISBN              -----String
        A book’s price             -----Decimal
        A book’s shipping weight   -----double
        A country’s population     -----long
        The number of stars in the universe  ----- long
        The number of employees in each of the small or medium businesses in the
        United Kingdom (up to about 50,000 employees per business)  ----int
    2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?
        The difference between value type and reference type variables
            1)Value type will directly hold the value, while reference type will hold the memory address;
            2)Value type are stored in stack memory, and reference type are stored in heap memory;
            3)Value type will not be collected by garbage collecter, while reference type will be;
            4)Value type can be created by Struct or Enum, while reference type can be created by class, interface, delegate or array;
            5)Value type cannot accept null values, but reference type can accept null values.
        Boxing: is the process of converting a value type to an object of the corresponding reference type;
        Unboxing: is the process of converting a reference type that represents a boxed value type back to its original value type.

    3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
        Managed resource is a resource that is managed by the .NET Framework's garbage collector, which automatically free up memory 
            that is no longer being used.
        Unmanaged resource is a resource that is not managed by the .NET Framework's garbage collector.

    4. Whats the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
        The purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET is to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation for objects that are crested
            during the execution of a .NET program.

Controlling Flow and Converting Types
    1. What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
        An System.DivdeByZeroException will be thrown.
    2. What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
        The result of a double variable divide by 0 is  ∞.
    3. What happens when you overflow an int variable, that is, set it to a value beyond its range?
        It will wrap around to the minimum value it can hold (-2147483648) and continue counting up from there.

    4. What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;?
        x = y++;
        The value of y will assigned to variable x and then the value of y will incremented by 1.
        x = ++y;
        The value of variable y will be incremented by 1 first, then the resulting value of y will be assigned to x.

    5. What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement?
        In C#, break, continue and return are keywords used inside a loop statement to change the control flow of the program.
            break: is used to immediately terminate the loop and continue executing the program after the loop.
            continue: is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and immediately move on to the next iteration.
            return: is used to immediately terminate the loop and return a value to the caller.
    6. What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required?
        The three parts of a for statement are initialization, condition and iteration. 
        The condition part is required.
    7. What is the difference between the = and == operators?
        The = operator is used to assign a value to a variable.
        The == operator is used to compare the values of two variables or expression.
    8. Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ;
        Yes, the statement is valid for loop statement and it will compile without any errors.
        But it is an infinite loop.
    9. What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
        The underscore is used in a switch expression to match any value that has not been matched by 
            other cases. 
    10. What interface must an object implement to be enumerated over by using the foreach statement
        The IEnumerable interface.

Practice loops and operators
    1. One error shown that the name "WriteLine" does not exist in the current context.
        We can use the #warning preprocessor directive to warning this.
