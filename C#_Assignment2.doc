Array and Strings

1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?
    The String class is immutable but the StringBuilder class is mutable.
    So we will use String when we  have a small string that we do not plan to modify, or we need to perform simple string 
        operations such as comparison, substring extraction or case conversion.
    We will use the StringBuilder class when we need to build or modify a string, or we are concatenating multiple strings together,
        or we are constructing a string dynamically by appending characters or substrings.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
    The base class for all arrays is the abstract class System.Array.

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
    In C#, you can sort an array using the Array.Sort method.

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
    You can use the Length property of an array object to get the total number of elements in the array.

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
    Yes, you can. Because the System.Array is a reference type, you can create an array of objects and store objects of 
        different types in it. However, you need to cast then to their appropriate data types when you want to access the 
        elements in the array.
        
6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
    The System.Array.CopyTo() method copies the elements of an array to an existing array starting at the specified index.
    The System.Array.Clone() method create a new array that is a shallow copy of the original array.
